My full name is Duc Ha Minh and I come from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I started to study the first programming namely "Data analysis with Python" on August 2020 and "Data Science" on January 2021.

These project are assignments in Data Science course at FUNIX. These files were completed and run well in Jupyter Notebook environment or Google Colab.
